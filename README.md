# knives

Adds various knives with extreme damage

# Knives

* Steel (10 Damage)
* Bronze (15 Damage)
* Mese (17 Damage)
* Diamond (20 Damage)

## Power Mode

Each knife supports Power Mode, it essentially doubles the damage dealt making it quite useful for one swing kills.

> While it doubles the damage it only has 1 use durability (this means it breaks on use)

# Settings

* Optional setting for if knives can be crafted (Supports default Minetest Game (MTG) and MineClone (MCL) games)
* Optional setting for if knives can enter Power Mode (Power Mode is currently a toggled state, and a player chooses if they want power mode or not)
